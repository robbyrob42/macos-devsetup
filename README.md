# macos-devsetup
.bash profile, prompt, aliases, vimrc, vundle config for easy new machine setup

I have leveraged https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup recommendations for setting up my Mac

and used https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles for some dotfiles

Huge fan of http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized colorscheme as well
